# Google Summer of Code 2025

**Project Title**: Randomized SDP solver and improved preprocessing. 
**Organization**: [Geomscale](https://geomscale.github.io), a [NumFOCUS](http://numfocus.org) affiliated organization. 
**Mentors**: Vissarion Fisikopoulos, Apostolos Chalkis, Zafeirakis Zafeirakopoulos. 

### Project Overview

During Google Summer of Code 2025, I worked on improving the Semidefinite Programming (SDP) solver with a focus on fixing numerical linear algebra issues, improving performace, and adding support for sparse test cases.

### What I Accomplished

My work was based on and expanded the research presented in [this paper on randomized SDP solvers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03817). I focused on fixing errors and improving the SDP solver while adding support for sparse test cases, advancing the VolEsti library's capabilities in semidefinite programming.

#### 1. Bug Fixes and Eigenvalue Problem Improvements

A significant portion of my work centered on eigenvalue problems, specifically addressing SDP reflection, membership testing, and related computational challenges. To tackle these problems, I utilized **Spectra** and **Eigen**, two powerful libraries for computational linear algebra. The performance improvements we achieved were substantial, though due to some remaining errors, it's difficult to quantify the exact speedup. Nevertheless, it's important to highlight that on certain test cases, the SDP solver now rivals **SDPA**, a well-established open-source project that has been in development for many years.

#### 2. Simulated Annealing and Reflective HMC Enhancements

I also implemented improvements to the simulated annealing algorithm and reflective Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (R-HMC). Specifically, I added:

- **Velocity persistence**: This technique works particularly well due to the convexity of our feasible set, allowing for more efficient exploration of the solution space
- **Adaptive step sizing**: This helps maintain a low reflection rate, which is crucial since reflections are computationally expensive operations

#### 3. Sparse SDP Support

Beyond the core solver improvements, my work included adding comprehensive support for sparse SDP problems. Sparse SDP structures are very common in practice, as this is the natural form of many real-world optimization problems. This addition makes VolEsti more accessible and valuable to the broader optimization community, enabling it to handle larger-scale problems that were previously intractable.

### Results and Impact

The enhancements enable the solver to:
- Handle larger problem instances with limited memory through sparse representations
- Process sparse problems significantly more efficiently than before
- Provide more reliable solutions across diverse test cases
- **Rival SDPA performance**: On several benchmark test cases, our solver demonstrates competitive performance with SDPA, a well-established open-source SDP solver that has been in active development for over a decade

The addition of sparse SDP support is particularly impactful, as sparse problem structures naturally arise in many real-world applications including control theory, combinatorial optimization, and machine learning, which broadens the applicability of the VolEsti library.

### What I Learned

This project deepened my understanding of:
- Semidefinite programming theory and algorithms
- Numerical linear algebra
- Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods
- Open-source development workflows

### Challenges Faced

The project presented several significant challenges that required careful problem-solving:

**Navigating a Large Codebase**: One of the initial hurdles was understanding the relatively large existing codebase. It was challenging to determine what needed to be modified versus what should remain unchanged, requiring substantial time investment in code analysisxw.

**Eigenvalue Problem Complexity**: The eigenvalue problems proved more complex than initially anticipated. It took considerable time to fully comprehend the issues and identify the most efficient approaches.

**Optimizing R-HMC for Specific Problem Structure**: A particularly interesting challenge was adapting Reflective Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (R-HMC) to work optimally for our specific optimization problem. Since we don't actually want to uniformly sample from the feasible area—our problem has a very specific structure—it was crucial to understand how to leverage this structure to our advantage for better performance.
