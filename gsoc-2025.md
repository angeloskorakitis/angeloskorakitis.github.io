# Google Summer of Code 2025

**Project Title**: Randomized SDP solver and improved preprocessing

**Organization**: [Geomscale](https://geomscale.github.io), a [NumFOCUS](http://numfocus.org) affiliated project

**Mentors**: Vissarion Fisikopoulos, Apostolos Chalkis, Zafeirakis Zafeirakopoulos


### Project Overview
During Google Summer of Code 2025, I contributed to enhancing the Semidefinite Programming (SDP) solver of the [VolEsti](https://github.com/GeomScale/volesti) library.
My project was inspired by the research of [Chalkis et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03817) and focused on improving the numerical stability and computational efficiency of the solver.  I also implemented support for sparse SDP problems and integrated a preprocessing technique known as Sieve-SDP. These improvements collectively strengthened the solver’s performance and robustness, significantly advancing VolEsti’s functionality in semidefinite programming.

### Summary of Contributions

#### 1. Eigenvalue Problem Stability Improvements

A major part of my work focused on eigenvalue problems, particularly involving spectrahedron membership, intersection, and reflection operations. Specifically, I focused on resolving several issues present in the previous implementation, regarding numerical linear algebra operations, leading to substantial performance gains. Although the initial errors make it difficult to quantify the exact speedup, the improved SDP solver now performs comparably to [SDPA](https://sdpa.sourceforge.net), a well-established open-source project. For more details, please refer to the relevant pull requests linked below.

#### 2. Simulated Annealing and Reflective HMC Enhancements

I also implemented improvements to the simulated annealing algorithm and reflective Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (R-HMC). Specifically, I added:

- Velocity persistence: This technique works particularly well due to the convexity of our feasible set, allowing for more efficient exploration of the solution space
- Adaptive step sizing: This helps maintain a low reflection rate, which is crucial since reflections are computationally expensive operations, and high trajectory completion of steps, reducing boundary hits and improving overall efficiency

#### 3. Sparse SDP Support

Beyond the core solver improvements, my work included adding comprehensive support for sparse SDP problems. Sparse SDP structures are very common in practice, as this is the natural form of many real-world optimization problems. This addition makes VolEsti more accessible and valuable to the broader optimization community, enabling it to handle larger-scale problems that were previously intractable.

#### 4. Sieve-SDP Preprocessing Integration

Finally, I integrated Sieve-SDP, a preprocessing algorithm designed to reduce the size of SDP problems before solving them. This integration allows VolEsti to preprocess problems effectively, leading to significant performance gains, in problems with specific structure. The implementation was based on the original [MATLAB code](https://github.com/unc-optimization/SieveSDP) provided by the authors of Sieve-SDP.

### Results and Impact

The enhancements enable the solver to:
- Faster, more robustly, and more accurately solve semidefinite programming problems
- Handle larger problem instances with reduced memory requirements through sparse representations
- Efficiently preprocess problems, reducing the discrepancy of problems with specific structure through Sieve-SDP, leading to performance gains
- **Rival SDPA performance**: On several benchmark test cases, our solver demonstrates competitive performance with SDPA, a well-established open-source SDP solver that has been in active development for over a decade. Having said that, we still need to implement more features to fully match SDPA's capabilities.

The addition of sparse SDP support is particularly impactful, as sparse problem structures naturally arise in many real-world applications including control theory, combinatorial optimization, and machine learning, which broadens the applicability of the VolEsti library.

### Challenges Faced

The project presented several significant challenges that required careful problem-solving:

- Navigating a Large Codebase: One of the initial hurdles was understanding the relatively large existing codebase. It was challenging to determine what needed to be modified versus what should remain unchanged, requiring substantial time investment in code analysis.

- Eigenvalue Problems: The eigenvalue problems proved more complex than initially anticipated. It took considerable time to fully comprehend the issues and identify the most efficient approaches.

- Optimizing R-HMC for Specific Problem Structure: A particularly interesting challenge was adapting Reflective Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (R-HMC) to work optimally for our specific optimization problem. Since we don't actually want to uniformly sample from the feasible area—our problem has a very specific structure—it was crucial to understand how to leverage this structure to our advantage for better performance.

### What I Learned

This project deepened my understanding of:
- Semidefinite programming theory and algorithms
- Numerical linear algebra
- Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods
- Open-source development workflows

Last but not least, I gained valuable experience in collaborating with mentors and contributing to an open-source project, which has been immensely rewarding both professionally and personally.
