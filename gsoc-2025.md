## Google Summer of Code 2025: SDP Solver Enhancements

### Project Overview

During Google Summer of Code 2025, I worked on improving the SDP (Semidefinite Programming) solver with a focus on bug fixes and adding support for sparse test cases.

### What I Accomplished

My work was based on and expanded the research presented in [this paper on randomized SDP solvers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03817). I focused on fixing errors and improving the SDP solver while adding support for sparse test cases, advancing the VolEsti library's capabilities in semidefinite programming.

#### 1. Bug Fixes and Eigenvalue Problem Improvements

A significant portion of my work centered on eigenvalue problems, specifically addressing SDP reflection, membership testing, and related computational challenges. To tackle these problems, I utilized **Spectra** and **Eigen**, two powerful libraries for computational linear algebra. The performance improvements we achieved were substantial, though due to some remaining errors, it's difficult to quantify the exact speedup. Nevertheless, it's important to highlight that on certain test cases, the SDP solver now rivals **SDPA**, a well-established open-source project that has been in development for many years.

#### 2. Simulated Annealing and Reflective HMC Enhancements

I also implemented improvements to the simulated annealing algorithm and reflective Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (R-HMC). Specifically, I added:

- **Velocity persistence**: This technique works particularly well due to the convexity of our feasible set, allowing for more efficient exploration of the solution space
- **Adaptive step sizing**: This helps maintain a low reflection rate, which is crucial since reflections are computationally expensive operations

#### 3. Sparse SDP Support

Beyond the core solver improvements, my work included adding comprehensive support for sparse SDP problems. Sparse SDP structures are very common in practice, as this is the natural form of many real-world optimization problems. This addition makes VolEsti more accessible and valuable to the broader optimization community, enabling it to handle larger-scale problems that were previously intractable.

### Technical Details

The implementation leverages:
- **Spectra** and **Eigen** libraries for efficient linear algebra operations
- Specialized algorithms for sparse matrix representations
- Optimized eigenvalue decomposition methods for both dense and sparse problems
- Velocity persistence mechanisms that exploit the convex geometry of the feasible region
- Adaptive step sizing to minimize expensive reflection operations

### Results and Impact

The enhancements enable the solver to:
- Handle larger problem instances with limited memory through sparse representations
- Process sparse problems significantly more efficiently than before
- Provide more reliable solutions across diverse test cases
- **Rival SDPA performance**: On several benchmark test cases, our solver demonstrates competitive performance with SDPA, a well-established open-source SDP solver that has been in active development for over a decade

The addition of sparse SDP support is particularly impactful, as sparse problem structures naturally arise in many real-world applications including:
- Machine learning optimization problems
- Control theory applications  
- Combinatorial optimization
- Structural engineering design

By supporting sparse SDPs efficiently, VolEsti becomes more accessible and valuable to researchers and practitioners across these diverse domains.

### What I Learned

This project deepened my understanding of:
- Semidefinite programming theory and algorithms
- Numerical optimization techniques
- Sparse linear algebra and efficient data structures
- Open-source development workflows

### Challenges Faced

The project presented several significant challenges that required careful problem-solving:

**Navigating a Large Codebase**: One of the initial hurdles was understanding the relatively large existing codebase. It was challenging to determine what needed to be modified versus what should remain unchanged, requiring substantial time investment in code analysis and architecture understanding.

**Eigenvalue Problem Complexity**: The eigenvalue problems proved more complex than initially anticipated. It took considerable time to fully comprehend the issues and identify the most efficient approaches. This part of the project required more time than I had originally estimated.

**Optimizing R-HMC for Specific Problem Structure**: A particularly interesting challenge was adapting Reflective Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to work optimally for our specific optimization problem. Since we don't actually want to uniformly sample from the feasible area—our problem has a very specific structure—it was crucial to understand how to leverage this structure to our advantage for better performance.

**Sparse Eigenvalue Algorithm Selection**: Another issue I encountered involved sparse eigenvalue problems, specifically in the boundary hit function. I initially used a linear algebra algorithm designed for dense problems, which wasn't optimal. This is an area that could definitely be improved in future iterations of the project.
