# About

I am currently an MSc student in [Algorithms, Logic and Discrete Mathematics](http://alma.di.uoa.gr), jointly offered by the University of Athens and the National Technical University of Athens, and a Research Scholar at [Archimedes AI](http://archimedesai.gr). Previously, I completed my BSc in Informatics and Telecommunications at the [University of Athens](https://en.uoa.gr/), where I did my thesis under the supervision of Prof. [Christos Tzamos](https://tzamos.com). My research interests include algorithms, optimization, and machine learning, with an emphasis on bridging theory and practice.
