# About

I am currently an MSc student in [Algorithms, Logic and Discrete Mathematics](http://alma.di.uoa.gr), jointly offered by the University of Athens and the National Technical University of Athens. Previously, I completed my BSc in Informatics and Telecommunications at the [University of Athens](https://en.uoa.gr/), where I did my thesis under the supervision of Prof. [Christos Tzamos](https://tzamos.com). I am broadly interested in Algorithms and Probability Theory.

Please feel free to reach out to me at my e-mail: angeloskorakitis at gmail dot com

In my free time I enjoy strolling around and taking photos. You can find some of them [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/199416085@N07/).
